# Toonie
A small software collection to make the development of small, time-intensive C++ projects more efficient.

Todo:

- leverage all the makefile features; use nested makefiles in the nested src/ directories; maybe try automake
- implement TComparable; abstract class implementing the equals and !equals operators
- TString class should take primitive parameters and use a primitive internal representation
- TString class should be a specialized container(?)
- split function should be more generic; outside of the string class; you may want to split any container
- implement iterators, common algorithms
