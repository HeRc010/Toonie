So! Some cool things to think about:

- prime number checking; custom number class? Maybe look into flexible precision too
- custom "containers"; a custom "vector" class, or "growable buffer" as labeled in Box2D; could allow for flexible underlying representation(like arrays, or stacks, or queues); that would be fun
- the implementation of some efficient algorithms would be good too; example: AKS for primes
